  - gnupg-agent prompt can't break through full-screen terminal
    * ultimate, however, I'd rather make the window decorations subtler and not use full-screen.
      that way i can still see the clock, battery, etc.
  - can i use something like dmenu to jump to an existing application/workspace?
  - gnome-keyring prompt is ugly
  - gnupg-agent prompt is ugly
  - hand cursor is ugly

  - urxvt alternate screen
  - urxvt BCE
  - urxvt vim cursor shape
    - doesn't work as root inside tmux
  - urxvt git commit message colors broken inside tmux
